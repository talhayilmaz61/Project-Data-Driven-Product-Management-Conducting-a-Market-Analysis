# Project-Data-Driven-Product-Management-Conducting-a-Market-Analysis
As a product manager for a fitness studio, dive into market analysis using Python to assess the demand for digital fitness classes. This project aims to identify trends and opportunities for growth in digital products and services, ensuring your studio stays ahead in the evolving fitness landscape.

Tasks:
Help the fitness studio explore interest in workouts at a global and national level.

When was the global search for 'workout' at its peak? Save the year of peak interest as a string named year_str in the format "yyyy".

Of the keywords available, what was the most popular during the covid pandemic, and what is the most popular now? Save your answers as variables called peak_covid and current respectively.

What country has the highest interest for workouts among the following: United States, Australia, or Japan? Save your answer as top_country.

You'd be interested in expanding your virtual home workouts offering to either the Philippines or Malaysia. Which of the two countries has the highest interest in home workouts? Identify the country and save it as home_workout_geo.
